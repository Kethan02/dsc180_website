**A New Credit Score** <br>
<br><br>

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**<br>
For our domain, we have our fixed project that we are going to end up working on which is coming up with our own credit score for a consumer. This score will essentially 
predict the risk of a consumer not paying his/her bills? An investigation that we are going to pursue would be looking into specific statistics about income and spending habits of the 
people in our data. This can give us a lot of information on how risky a consumer is. A main thing I would like to look at is biases. For example, income bias. Income doesn't have 
to be a recurring payment. There can be a multitude of ways that people can have inflow that allows them to survive. Accounting for this is key as we don't want to mis-categorize 
people as risky, just because they don't have a recurring income. It's not just income bias, but combining our cleaning and classifications together on our consumers can result in 
inaccurate results. Therefore an important investigation and key challenge we have to be aware of is whether our steps are accurate to an extent. We don't want to be leaving any 
groups unrepresented. This ties back to the idea of the model being generalized instead of being made specifically on our dataset so it can be reused with different data.
<br><br>

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**<br>
A potential change in approach I would like to take is become more aggressive in our model creation. I want to try more methods, whether it be new cleaning methods or different 
classification models, to see if we can improve our accuracy even more. This past quarter our group worked in conjunction testing new methods together as we familiarized ourself with 
the dataset. Now that we have built an initial model, understand our domain more, and know our final goal; I want to focus how we approach the problem. Instead of working on the same 
things I want to create a schedule/weekly task system where all of us can choose what part of the project we want to explore. Therefore we can explore multiple methods quickly as we 
all explore different ideas to implement into our model, feature list, etc. Every week we can do this for the task we have assigned. This will allow us to gain more ground as we can 
tackle our problem from multiple angles simultaneously.
<br><br>

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**<br>
A technique that I would be interested in using is deep learning. I have had experience previously through CSE 151B, the deep learning class, but I really didn't understand how to 
implement a model properly. As we test multiple models for our credit score creation, I want to eventually try a deep learning model to understand how it can be used in a real-world 
application. Apart from just different models, understanding the dataset and learning the trends with credit card data is very interesting. Running statistics such as avg consumer 
spend, avg transactions per consumer, and relating dates with purchases can teach us a lot about someone's potential credit risk. Even though it's just a bunch of numbers, there are 
a multitude of statistics and statistical tests that can be ran to identify outliers or specific trends that can help us in our project. I've learned about many probability variables 
from MATH 183 and so on and I feel like this project would be the perfect place for me to generate and look into the probability distributions of the variables in the dataset. 
Regardless of whether we use it in the final dataset, I feel like many statistical tests, like chi-sqaured or ttest, can be used to gain a lot of information from the consumer data 
which can be used in another way to assess a consumers risk.
